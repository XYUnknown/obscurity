It is not my fault. And even if it is my fault, I should not be punished like this.

I never tried to hurt anyone. Yet people tried to hurt me.

I don't think that I understand how this could happen. Like, I have not done anything wrong. Why they are trying to hurt me.

I hate these people. I really hate them.

The only thing I am familiar with in my life is being hurt. The only thing never changes in my life is pain.

I have been staring at the end point, namely, death, for too long. I have given up this life long time ago. I am not consciously living. I am still alive only because the animal instinct of not wanting to die.
