It has been more than two years.

I never forget. I don not suffer from amnesia. But I do not exactly remember what happened.

I cannot remember the incident from a first-person perspective. I deleted myself from that period of my life. I clearly rememebr what happened, on "me", which is a foreign and almost alien version of myself. It is dissociated from my current existence. I keep staring at a form of myself that I cannot relate myself to. I clearly remember everything, but I cannot remember them as a part of *my* experience.

It is a scary feeling, like there is a hole in my life that can never be filled in.
