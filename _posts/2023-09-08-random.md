I am unable to *feel*.

I have been really tired these days, like, so tired that I would rather die.

One may ask, you knew **A** is a terrible person, there have been all kinds of signs - **A** never said anything positive about any collaborator; **A** always indicate their collaborators being bothersome and incompetent; **A** is a liar; **A** would always try to rephrase as much content you have written as possible, by doing so completely remove your thinking, ideas and authorship of the paper... Why did you even tolerate **A**?

I cannot really answer -- I think I am flawed.

I had chosen to stay in this terrible situation, because I knew it is terrible and I knew *what* were terrible. It's horrible, but the horror is known. My subconscious tend to choose things are known -- even if they are terrible -- over things are unknown -- even if they may be nice and positive.

In the end, it is my fault to not leave the situation I hate.

I fear it's too late now.

There is nothing left -- I feel -- hollow. Like I am just a shell without any content inside, or, I feel dead.

This is my fault -- I allowed such thing happened again. All my choices have led to misfortune, because misfortune is the only thing I am familiar with in my life.

I am really tired.
